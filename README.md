ActionFramework BaseAPI
=======================

__THIS GEM IS WORKING, BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR PRODUCTION USE FOR NOW__

This is just a sideproject of me that I would like to merge with ActionFramework in the future.

I finally got this working.

This project has nothing to do with ActionFramework itself, it is just a submodule for it.

## Getting started

Install the gem by executing the following command:

    [sudo] gem install actionframework-baseapi

In the tests/ directory you can find some examples on the usage of the framework.
